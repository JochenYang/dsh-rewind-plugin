/**
 * The transcript row for the `/rewind` command.
 *
 * A command's result text is rendered verbatim by the kernel's generic card, and
 * this repo's rule is that a host half sends a stable code rather than
 * user-visible prose. Without a renderer of its own, `/rewind` would therefore
 * print the raw `{"code":"rewind.host.list",…}` payload into the conversation —
 * which is exactly what it did before this module existed.
 *
 * This renderer is registered into the keyed `conversation.chat.commandview`
 * slot under the command's name, so it replaces the generic card for `/rewind`
 * only. It resolves the coded payload through this plugin's dictionary and falls
 * back to the host's English diagnostic for a code this build does not know.
 *
