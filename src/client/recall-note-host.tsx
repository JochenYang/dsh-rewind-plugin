/**
 * The recall note, rendered through the host's own `Toast`.
 *
 * `showRecallNote` is imperative — it is called from a promise handler, not from
 * render — so the message is pushed into a tiny store and this component renders
 * the `Toast` for it. A React tree is required because `Toast` is a component and
 * owns its own hold timer; a bare DOM node could not drive that.
 *
 * The store is module-level and single-slot on purpose: two recall outcomes are
 * never worth showing at once, and the newer one is always the relevant one. Each
 * note carries a `seq` so the `Toast` remounts for a repeat of the same sentence
 * (a `key` on the text alone would not re-trigger the timer).
