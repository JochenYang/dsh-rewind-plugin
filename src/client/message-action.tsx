/**
 * The per-message recall icon, and the wrapper that puts it on a user bubble.
 *
 * ## Why a wrapper and not a slot
 *
 * The kernel has no slot on a user-message bubble: the only message-actions
 * slot (`conversation.chat.assistant-actions`) is reached from the assistant
 * turn tail, and nothing equivalent exists for the user side. So the icon rides
 * the built-in `user` renderer, which this module wraps.
 *
 * Wrapping is only safe for a renderer that does NOT call `renderSlot` itself:
 * a wrapper cannot supply the child-slot renderers the owner would have passed,
 * and the slot system retires a registration that throws. `UserMessageNodeView`
 * calls `renderSlot` zero times (measured on 0.2.0-rc.2) — unlike `turn-tail`,
 * which calls it three times and must never be wrapped.
 *
 * The wrapper resolves the built-in component through `slots.entries(...)` at
 * mount and re-resolves while it is absent, because registration order is not
 * guaranteed: this plugin may load before the chat package registers `user`.
 * It renders `null` until the built-in is found rather than drawing a
 * second-rate bubble.
 *
 * ## The locale seat
 *
 * `ChatNodeViewProps` carries a `t` seat bound to the CHAT namespace, and the
 * renderer receives it as a normal prop. The wrapper therefore forwards the
 * props it was given unchanged — including `t` — and only adds the icon. It
 * must NOT substitute its own namespace's `t`: this plugin's `t` throws on a
 * key it does not own, so the built-in's `chat.…` lookups would fail.
 *
