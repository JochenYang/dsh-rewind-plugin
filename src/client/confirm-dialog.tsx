/**
 * The recall confirmation: what will change, before it changes.
 *
 * A recall is destructive — it rewrites files and moves others aside — and the
 * first version simply did it and reported afterwards. That is the one shape a
 * user cannot consent to: by the time the sentence appears, the tree has already
 * changed. This dialog is the missing step.
 *
 * ## Built from the host's own primitives, not hand-rolled
 *
 * An earlier version drew its own mask, card and buttons with plugin CSS. That
 * looked subtly wrong in both themes and drifted from every other dialog in the
 * suite — the tokens were right and the composition was not. `Modal` and `Button`
 * from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives` are the host's own: they carry the
 * mask, the blur, the elevation, the close affordance, focus handling, Escape and
 * the modal layer, and they follow a theme change for free. A plugin composes
 * them; it does not re-draw them.
 *
 * The `RiskConfirmation` primitive is deliberately NOT used even though the
 * action is destructive: it requires an acknowledgement checkbox, which suits a
 * one-shot irreversible choice. A recall is neither one-shot nor irreversible —
 * everything displaced lands in the quarantine — and the per-file preview below
 * is the confirmation the user actually needs.
 *
 * ## The unrestorable note is the point
 *
 * A preview that lists only the changes it CAN make teaches the user to trust it.
 * A file a shell command touched is invisible to this plugin, so it cannot appear
 * as a row — but staying silent would read as "nothing else changed", which is
 * false. The note below the list is therefore always present, zero included.
 *
 * @module dsh-rewind-plugin/client/confirm-dialog
