/**
 * Where a recall's outcome is reported.
 *
 * The note used to sit inside the icon's own row. That row lives in the turn the
 * recall just hid, so `display:none` took the note with it — the diagnostic was
 * invisible in exactly the case it existed for: a recall that landed while the
 * composer prefill did not, which is what a user reports as "nothing happened".
 *
 * ## The host's own Toast, not a hand-rolled overlay
 *
 * The second attempt wrote a fixed `div` onto `document.body` with plugin CSS.
 * That is the same mistake as redrawing a dialog: it got the tokens right and the
 * placement, layering, fade and dismissal wrong, so it read as a stray element
 * floating over the composer. `Toast` from `@deepseek-ai/dsh-client-ui-primitives`
 * is the host's own announcement surface — it portals to the body, sits above
 * every overlay, fades itself out on a single `--dsh-toast-hold` value, never
 * intercepts a click, and anchors under a given element. The kernel's own
 * agent-preset refusal uses it exactly this way (`anchor: the composer card`),
 * which is why this module anchors there too.
 *
 * ## The hold time
 *
 * A refusal is longer than the primitive's 3s default on purpose: the kernel's own
 * refusal banner holds 8s (`REFUSAL_HOLD_MS` in the agent-preset client), because
 * a sentence a user must READ before acting cannot vanish at announcement speed.
 * A diagnostic that explains a skipped prefill is the same kind of message, so it
 * gets the same 8s.
 *
 * @module dsh-rewind-plugin/client/recall-note
