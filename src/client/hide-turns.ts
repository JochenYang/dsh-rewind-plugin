/**
 * The stylesheet that hides the turns a recall removed.
 *
 * The transcript deliberately renders the append-origin log, so a landed
 * replacement does NOT remove the old bubbles (compaction behaves the same way).
 * The host's `rewindAnchors` projection publishes which turns a recall already
 * cut, and this module turns that list into CSS: one `display:none` rule per
 * turn, keyed on the `data-chat-turn` attribute the chat flow wrapper puts on
 * every node. Turns are the right unit — a recall always cuts at a turn head,
 * so the whole turn goes away together and no half-turn is left behind.
 *
 * ## Why the element is process-wide, not component-owned
 *
 * The hook is called by the per-message wrapper, which is mounted once per user
 * bubble — so SEVERAL instances run at once. A component-owned element cannot
 * work here: React runs an effect's cleanup before the next effect, so the
 * second bubble's mount would blank the stylesheet the first had just written,
 * and unmounting any one bubble (a virtualized row scrolling away) would blank it
 * for the whole transcript.
 *
 * The element is therefore created once per document and only ever written, never
 * emptied — the rules are a pure function of the projected hidden-turn list, so
 * the last writer is always the right one. It is left in place for the document's
 * lifetime, which is what a stylesheet keyed on a stable id is for; `recall-note`
 * follows the same pattern for the same reason.
 *
