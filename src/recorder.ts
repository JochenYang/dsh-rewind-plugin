/**
 * The file-change recorder: watches the two pre-write waterfalls and remembers
 * each file's before-image, keyed to the turn that changed it.
 *
 * ## Why `prepend`
 *
 * `ctx.on` runs listeners in registration order and a waterfall listener that
 * does not call `next()` ENDS the chain. The kernel's own
 * `dsh-fs-observation-policy` installs a `fs/write-intent` listener that returns
 * the CAS guard and never forwards (`dsh-fs-observation-policy/lib/index.js`).
 *
 * A listener registered normally therefore never runs at all when that policy is
 * mounted — and it fails SILENTLY: writes keep working, no error is raised, and
 * the recorder simply captures nothing. `{ prepend: true }` puts this listener
 * first, and returning `next()`'s value hands the policy its own guard so the
 * write behaves exactly as it would have.
 *
 * Measured against the real `LocalFileSystem` in
 * `scratch/probe-fs-write-intent-real.mjs`: 7/7 checks, including that the write
 * still lands its exact bytes with the recorder installed.
 *
 * ## Why the capture is not awaited
 *
 * The waterfall is on the write's critical path — the `write` tool awaits it
 * before touching the file. Awaiting a full file read there would slow every
 * write in the session, so the read is started and the `next()` chain is returned
 * immediately. The ordering that matters is preserved: the read is STARTED
 * before the write happens, so it sees the pre-write bytes. A capture that is
 * still in flight when the turn is recalled is reported as unrestorable rather
 * than guessed at.
 *

 *
 * `turn/end` deliberately does NOT reset it. That is the rule the projection
 * already uses (`projection.ts` only advances on `turn/start`), and the two MUST
 * agree: the projection's turn numbers are what the recall asks the recorder to
 * restore, so a recorder that reset on `turn/end` would file a write under `null`
 * while the recall asked for the turn by number — found nothing, restored
 * nothing, and reported success.

 * @returns the last opened turn at or before `seq`, or null before the first one.
