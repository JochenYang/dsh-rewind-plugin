/**
 * File snapshots for a recall: the before-image of every file a turn changed.
 *
 * ## What this can and cannot see
 *
 * The host gives a plugin two pre-write waterfalls — `fs/write-intent` and
 * `fs/edit-intent` — and exactly two packages dispatch them:
 * `dsh-tool-fs` (`write`, `edit`) and `dsh-tool-str-replace-editor`. Measured on
 * this machine's own session logs, those are 3481 of 15196 tool calls (22.9%).
 *
 * A shell command that creates, moves, rewrites or deletes a file (`pwsh`,
 * `run_code`) never passes through here — 4772 calls (31.4%) — and neither does
 * any tool that writes through its own fs handle. Those changes are invisible to
 * this module by construction, and the restore step must say so rather than
 * pretend the tree was put back.
 *
 * ## Why a quarantine instead of undo
 *
 * Nothing is ever deleted. A restored file's CURRENT bytes are moved into the
 * quarantine directory before the before-image is written back, and a file the
 * recalled turn CREATED is moved there too instead of being unlinked. That keeps
 * the recall itself reversible: a wrong recall is recoverable by hand, and a file
 * the user changed during the turn is not lost. Deleting would make an
 * already-destructive action irreversible, which is the one thing a feature like
 * this must not do.

 * Restore one file to a snapshot, quarantining what is there now.

 * failure between the two steps leaves the original safe rather than lost. The
 * before-image is then written back as a direct write (not a rename) so a
 * cross-device quarantine root cannot fail the restore.
 *
 * ## Why nothing here renames
 *
 * The quarantine lives under `$DSH_HOME`, which is on a different volume from the
 * workspace on a very ordinary setup (this machine: `$DSH_HOME` on `C:`, the
 * project on `D:`). `rename` across volumes fails with `EXDEV`, so a "move it into
 * the quarantine" written as a rename works only when both happen to share a
 * drive — and fails silently for a created file, which is exactly the case that
 * has no other path. Everything here is therefore read + write + unlink, which
 * behaves the same on one volume and on two.
 *
 * The unlink is the ONE delete this plugin performs, and it runs only after the
 * content is safely written to the quarantine: a crash between the two leaves a
 * duplicate, never a loss.
 *
 * @param snapshot - the captured before-image.
 * @param quarantineDir - where displaced content is kept.
 * @param now - clock for the quarantine slot name.
 * @returns a description of what happened, for the report.
