/**
 * DSH APP rewind — client half.
 *
 * Contributes one visible entry point and four pieces of housekeeping:
 *
 *   1. a hover icon under each user message — the fast path, and the only one a
 *      user sees without typing;
 *   2. a stylesheet that hides the turns a recall removed;
 *   3. the composer prefill — the recalled text back in the input box;
 *   4. the `/rewind` command's picker and transcript row, for the deliberate
 *      path and for keyboard users;
 *   5. the quarantine manager, a tab of the suite's maintenance settings section
 *      that lists and discards the files a recall displaced.
 *
 * Everything the entry points SHOW comes from the host's `rewindAnchors`
 * projection, read through the standard `useProjection` seat — this half never
 * folds session events. The prefill is the one piece of data that does not:
 * it rides the command result, because a projection is durable state a reload
 * replays, and a replayed prefill re-fills the composer forever.
 *
 * ## The per-message icon wraps the built-in renderer
 *
 * The kernel has no action slot on a user-message bubble (`assistant-actions`
 * is reached from the assistant turn tail, and nothing equivalent exists on the
 * user side), so the icon rides the built-in `user` renderer through a wrapper
 * registered at `priority: -1`. That is safe only for a renderer that does NOT
 * call `renderSlot` itself — a wrapper cannot supply the child-slot renderers
 * the owner would have passed, and a throwing registration is retired by the
 * slot system. `UserMessageNodeView` calls `renderSlot` zero times on
 * 0.2.0-rc.2; `turn-tail` calls it three times and must never be wrapped. The
 * wrapper also forwards every prop it receives, including the chat-bound `t`
 * seat, so the built-in's own copy keeps resolving.
 *
 * ## Hiding what was recalled
 *
 * The transcript deliberately renders the append-origin log, so a landed
 * replacement does NOT remove the old bubbles (compaction behaves the same way).
 * This half therefore hides the affected turns itself, using the `data-chat-turn`
 * attribute the chat flow wrapper puts on every node. Turns are the right unit:
 * a recall always cuts at a turn head, so the whole turn goes away together and
 * no half-turn is left behind.
 *
 * The hidden-turn set becomes a PROCESS-WIDE `<style>` element that is only ever
 * written, never emptied — see `client/hide-turns.ts` for why a component-owned
 * element cannot work here. An earlier version of this comment claimed the
 * element was owned by the icon wrapper and removed with it, which is the
 * opposite of what the code does; following it would reintroduce the bug where a
 * single bubble unmounting un-hides the whole transcript.
 *
 * ## Stability discipline
 *
 * The service names this half touches (`remote`, `sessions`, the projection key)
 * are read structurally through `ctx.get` and checked at every step. When one is
 * absent the icon reports that recall is unavailable instead of throwing — a
 * throwing component blanks its slot entry.

 * Watch every session for a `/rewind` result that this client did not issue.

 * value to read. Watching the log is what makes both entry points behave alike.

 *
 * ## Why the dedupe key is the recall's own event sequence
 *
 * The icon path calls the command and prefills from its return value; the SAME
 * recall then lands in this feed as a `command/done`, and a second write would
 * report `the composer already holds text` on a recall that worked perfectly.
 * An earlier version of this comment claimed that could not happen because the
 * write refuses a non-empty composer — it can, and it did, on a real machine.
 *
 * `sourceEventSeq` names the placeholder event the host appended, so it is the

 * already handled makes the two paths converge on one write per recall, which is
 * the one-shot discipline the whole delivery design exists to keep.

/**
 * Put a recalled message's original text back in the composer, once.
 *
 * The prompt travels in the command result (`rewind.host.done`), so this runs
 * only when a recall actually succeeds in THIS page session. It deliberately
 * does NOT come from the projection: that is durable state a reload replays,
 * which made the text reappear in the composer on every reload.
 *
 * The composer face is read off the MATERIALIZED session binding, reached
 * through `uiSession.bindingSource` — see {@link UiSessionSlice} for why the raw
 * `sessions.binding(id)` does not carry it. Only an idle, empty composer is
 * written, because `setDraft` replaces everything the user typed.
 *
 * ## Why every step reports a reason
 *
 * This used to `return` silently at each guard, and a silent return is
 * indistinguishable from a working write: the recall succeeded, the message left
 * the transcript, and nothing appeared in the composer — with nothing anywhere
 * saying which step refused. The caller now surfaces this reason, so one
 * real-machine run pinpoints the step instead of guessing.
 *
 * ## Why a draft that already holds the text is SUCCESS, not a refusal
 *
 * TWO writers race on one recall, and both are legitimate:
 *
 *   - the icon path writes from the command RESULT when the RPC returns;
 *   - the event observer writes when it sees the `command/done` event.
 *
 * The event can arrive first, so the result path then finds a non-empty composer
 * — holding the very text it was about to write — and reported "the composer
 * already holds text" on a recall that worked perfectly. Marking the recall as
 * handled cannot fix that: the mark happens when the RPC returns, which is after
 * the observer has already run.
 *
 * The write is therefore IDEMPOTENT: finding exactly this text already in place
 * is the outcome it wanted, so it reports success and writes nothing. Any OTHER
 * text still refuses, because `setDraft` would replace what the user typed.
 *
 * @param ctx - the client root context.
 * @param sessionId - the session the recall happened in.
 * @param raw - the command result's text, carrying the coded payload.
 * @returns `undefined` when the text is in the composer, otherwise why not.
