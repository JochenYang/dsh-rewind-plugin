/**
 * The recall computation, kept free of cordis and of any session object so it
 * is unit-testable and so the executor layer stays thin.
 *
 * Three things live here:
 *
 * 1. **Anchor enumeration** — which user messages on the current model-visible
 *    surface are recallable, newest first.
 * 2. **Cut computation** — turning "recall ordinal n" into the exact
 *    replacement range the kernel's surface fold will accept.
 * 3. **Placeholder construction** — the empty-content event that carries the
 *    replacement.
 *
 * ## Why the placeholder is a `user/message`, not a `system/message`
 *
 * The kernel's PERSISTENCE validator (not the in-memory append path) requires a
 * `system/message` to match the currently open turn AND step, and a recall runs
 * while the agent is idle — no turn is open. `append` accepts such a
 * placeholder, the write succeeds, and the session then fails to load with
 * `SessionFormatError: system/message does not match an open turn and step`.
 * `user/message` is not a step event type, so it carries no such requirement;
 * {@link placeholderData} builds it with empty content and this plugin's own
 * source kind, and the DeepSeek provider's request path drops an empty user
 * message so it contributes no model-facing turn while `deriveEventMessage` still
 * keeps it on the surface. That drop is PROVIDER behaviour, not a kernel
 * guarantee — `dsh-llm-pi-ai` sends an empty user message as-is
 * (`dsh-llm-pi-ai/lib/index.js`) — so switching providers would put one empty
 * user message into the request.
 * Full reasoning and the measured surface: `scratch/probe-rewind-persist.mjs`.
 *
 * The cut also always starts on a user message, which is by construction the
 * first node of its turn. That matters: a cut landing mid-turn leaves the
 * turn's later `tool/result` events with no preceding call in the derived
 * history, and a provider rejects that transcript. Cutting at the turn head
 * keeps every shadowed range whole.
 *

/**
 * Build the placeholder payload for a replacement.
 *
 * ## Why this is a `user/message` and not a `system/message`
 *
 * The kernel's PERSISTENCE validator (not the in-memory append path) requires a
 * `system/message` to match the currently open turn AND step:
 *
 *   requireStep(event, data) {
 *     if (this.turn === null || this.step === null
 *         || data["turn"] !== this.turn || data["step"] !== this.step)
 *       throw new SessionFormatError(`${event.type} does not match an open turn and step`)
 *   }
 *
 * A recall runs while the agent is idle — no turn is open — so a system-role
 * placeholder can NEVER satisfy that rule. `append` accepts it (it validates the
 * surface only), the write succeeds, and the session then fails to load:
 *
 *   SessionFormatError: system/message does not match an open turn and step
 *
 * `user/message` is not a step event type, so it carries no such requirement.
 * Its content is empty, and the request path drops a user message whose content
 * filters to nothing, so it contributes no model-facing turn — while
 * `deriveEventMessage` still keeps it on the surface, which is exactly what a
 * replacement node must do.
 *
 * This is verified against the kernel's released v4 relationship validator and
 * a real session log in `scratch/probe-rewind-persist.mjs`; see also
 * `scratch/scan-session-damage.mjs`, which locates the sessions the earlier
 * system-role placeholder corrupted.
