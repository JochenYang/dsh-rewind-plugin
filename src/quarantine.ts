/**
 * Reading and pruning the quarantine.
 *
 * The quarantine is the feature's safety net: every file a recall displaced is
 * kept there so the recall stays reversible. That safety is only real if a user
 * can SEE what is in it and clear it out — an append-only directory under
 * `$DSH_HOME` with no face is just a slow leak, and one nobody can audit.
 *
 * ## Why the manifest, not the directory name
 *
 * A slot's directory is named from a timestamp and a path hash. That is enough to
 * keep two same-second slots apart and nothing else: it does not say which file
 * the content came from, so a listing built from names alone could only ever show
 * `replaced`. Every slot therefore carries a `manifest.json` written at the same
 * moment as the content, and this module reads it.
 *
 * A slot whose manifest is missing or unreadable is still listed — marked
 * unknown — rather than hidden. An entry a user cannot see is an entry they
 * cannot reclaim, which defeats the point of keeping it.
 *
 * @module dsh-rewind-plugin/quarantine
