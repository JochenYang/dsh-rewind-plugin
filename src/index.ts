/**
 * DSH APP rewind — host half.
 *
 * Adds the capability stock dsh lacks: **recall a message you already sent**.
 * A sent message cannot be edited or withdrawn; this plugin cuts the current
 * model-visible surface back to before a chosen user message and hands the
 * original text back to the composer so it can be corrected and re-sent.
 *
 * ## How the cut works
 *
 * The session log is append-only and stays the source of truth. What the model
 * reads is the *surface*: an ordered view folded from the log, where a
 * message-producing event either appends to the tail or replaces a range
 * (`surfaceOp: { op: 'replace', startSeq, endSeq }`). A recall is one such
 * replacement, so:
 *
 *   - the recalled message and everything after it leave the model's view;
 *   - nothing is deleted — the log keeps every event, and a reader that ignores
 *     surface ops still sees the full human transcript;
 *   - the client keeps rendering the append-origin log (deliberate in the
 *     kernel: a landed replacement must not erase what the user already saw),
 *     which is why this plugin also tells the client which turns to hide.
 *
 * The placeholder is an empty-content `user/message` carrying this plugin's own
 * source kind, never a `system/message`: the persistence validator requires a
 * system message to match the currently OPEN turn and step, and a recall happens
 * while the agent is idle, so a system-role placeholder writes fine and then
 * makes the session unloadable. An empty user message contributes no model-facing
 * turn while `deriveEventMessage` still keeps it on the surface. See
 * `placeholderData` in `./cut.ts`.
 *
 * ## Guards
 *
 * A cut always starts on a user message, which is by construction the head of
 * its turn, so every shadowed range is whole. A cut taken mid-turn would leave
 * that turn's later `tool/result` events without their call in the derived
 * history, and a provider rejects such a transcript — so a running turn is
 * refused outright rather than raced.
 *
 * ## Where the state lives
 *
 * Everything the client needs is derived from the log by the
 * `rewindAnchors` projection (see `./projection.ts`), including the original
 * text of the most recent cut. Projection state is checkpointed and, failing
 * that, rebuilt by replaying the log, so no separate vault file is needed: the
 * log itself is the durable record, and a recall never removes anything from it.
 *
 * ## Stability discipline
 *
 * `commands` and `sessionProjections` are framework seams, so the plugin stays
 * inactive on a profile that lacks either instead of throwing at load. Nothing
 * here mutates a prototype, writes outside the plugin's own storage, or fails
 * the boot.
 *
