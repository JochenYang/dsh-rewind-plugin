/**
 * Tests for the injected stylesheet's load-bearing rules.
 *
 * The per-message icon is invisible by default and revealed on hover, so the
 * reveal selector is behaviour, not decoration: it was written once as
 * `.dshRewind-iconRow:hover`, which never fired because that row sits BELOW the
 * bubble — hovering the message left the pointer outside it. These tests pin the
 * selector to the chat flow item, which is what the user actually hovers.
 *
 * The stylesheet is read from source rather than from the bundle so a rule that
 * the minifier drops is still caught here.
